    <p>Welcome! This is my daily blog about the day in the life of being a cat owner. Meet Darla, my orange tabby cat.</p>
  
  <p>This is Darla.</p>

  <p> Darla is exceptionally well behaved and is also very friendly with children. She will often spend her time trying to get you to rub her belly. She turns two years old in November and I cant wait to see what new adventures we have in the years to come!</p>
